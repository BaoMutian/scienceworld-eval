# ScienceWorld environment context for extraction prompts
ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT = """## ScienceWorld Environment Background

ScienceWorld is a text-based interactive environment for testing scientific reasoning abilities.
The agent navigates rooms, manipulates objects, and performs science experiments through text commands.

### Key Environment Features:
- **Navigation**: Rooms connected by doors/portals (kitchen, living room, outside, etc.)
- **Objects**: Various containers, substances, tools, and living things
- **State Changes**: Objects can change state (solid/liquid/gas), temperature, location
- **Scientific Tasks**: Include melting, boiling, freezing, mixing, growing plants, electrical circuits, etc.

### Available Action Types:
- Movement: go to [location], teleport to [location]
- Observation: look around, look at [object], look in [container], examine [object]
- Manipulation: pick up [object], put [object] in [container], open/close [container]
- Interaction: activate/deactivate [device], use [tool] on [object], connect/disconnect [objects]
- Task-specific: focus on [object], pour [liquid] in [container], mix [container], eat [food]
- Waiting: wait, wait1 (for time-dependent processes like heating, growing)

### Common Challenges:
- Finding objects requires systematic room exploration
- Temperature changes require heat sources (stove, fireplace) or cooling (freezer, outside)
- Many tasks require specific sequences (e.g., focus -> action -> wait)
- Electrical tasks need proper circuit connections

# Prompt for extracting strategies from successful trajectories
EXTRACTION_PROMPT_SUCCESS = """You are an expert at analyzing science experiment trajectories and extracting reusable reasoning strategies.

{environment_context}
## Task Context
- Task Type: {task_type}
- Task Goal: {goal}
- Result: SUCCESS

## Trajectory
{trajectory}

## Instructions
Analyze this SUCCESSFUL trajectory and extract 1-3 reusable strategies that contributed to success.
For each strategy, provide:
1. **title**: A short, descriptive name (e.g., "Heat Source Selection", "Systematic Object Search")
2. **description**: A one-sentence summary of when this strategy applies
3. **content**: Detailed actionable insight including specific commands or patterns that work

Focus on:
- Key decision points that led to success
- Efficient patterns or shortcuts discovered
- Scientific reasoning that could apply to similar tasks
- Specific action sequences that are reusable

## Output Format
Return a JSON array of strategy objects:
```json
[
  {{
    "title": "Strategy Name",
    "description": "When to use this strategy",
    "content": "Detailed explanation of the strategy and how to apply it, including specific commands"

For each lesson, provide:

2. **description**: A one-sentence summary of the pitfall to avoid
3. **content**: Detailed explanation of what went wrong and how to prevent it

Focus on:
- Critical mistakes or wrong assumptions
- Inefficient patterns that wasted steps
- Missing scientific knowledge that caused the failure
- What the correct approach should have been

## Output Format

## Instructions
Compare these {num_trajectories} trajectories for the SAME task and extract insights:
1. If some succeeded and some failed, identify what distinguishes successful from failed attempts
2. If all succeeded, identify consistent winning strategies
3. If all failed, identify common pitfalls to avoid

Extract 1-3 high-quality strategies/lessons that:
- Are consistent across multiple attempts (not coincidental)
- Represent general scientific reasoning patterns
- Include specific action sequences or commands that work/fail
- Could help with similar future tasks
